# animal-game
 This project features an Animal Kingdom game that utilizes object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstract and concrete classes, and interfaces. Various animal classes showcase unique behaviors, demonstrating code reusability through inheritance and dynamic method invocation via polymorphism. Abstract classes define common characteristics, while interfaces outline animal behaviors for added flexibility. UML diagrams illustrate class relationships and methods, providing a clear structure for the application. Overall, the project exemplifies effective design and implementation of complex systems.
